            <h3>Is Python the best coding language to learn?</h3> 
            What are the best languages that have the most marketability?
            I'll tell you a secret: “Python" is not a marketable skill, and nor is any other programming language. 
            
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Marketable skills do NOT look like this: </dt>
                <dd>Knows Python</dd> 
                <dd>Knows C++</dd> 
                <dd>Knows Java</dd> 
                <dd>..etc</dd> <br>
            <dt>They look more like this: </dt>
                <dd>Web development in React/Angular</dd>
                <dd>Android development in Java</dd>
                <dd>RESTful microservices development in NodeJS</dd>
                <dd>etc</dd>
        </dl>



        <p>
The what i.e. the domain of the skill is primary; the how i.e. languages, frameworks and other tools is still important, but secondary.

On your resume and interviews you should be describing what you can do, and what is your experience in doing it including the “how". This is not necessarily job experience, but can also be personal projects or projects accomplished during a degree program or coding boot camp or hackathon or wherever.

By the way, you DO need experience writing actual software in one domain or another (backend, frontend, full stack, mobile, UX, cloud, ML, OS, games, desktop apps, embedded systems, firmware, compiler/language design, site reliability, networks, QA, DevOps, security, etc etc the list goes on) — and that experience has to be relevant to the job you're applying for. Not necessarily an exact match, especially not at entry level, but at least partially relevant in terms of domain knowledge.

Once again, if you're saying “look at me, I can write Haskell code!!1!” and that's the primary emphasis of your resume, then unfortunately that's the sign of a real novice.
        </p>
        <p>
You have to look at it from the employer's perspective. No one is going to hire you to do something you can't already do, where you can’t demonstrate some baseline level of competency. (Again, that's not necessarily a Catch—22 at entry level, because personal or collaborative or open-source projects still count, as do education and other forms of experience.) Listing “I can write Python code to make the computer do what I want" on your application to be a data scientist/ML engineer is… just a little bit too vague, you know? It's like saying “I can use the English language to express ideas in writing.” OK, that's a start, but… tell me more. What ideas did you express? In what context? For what purpose? With what results? Could you tell me about an example?
