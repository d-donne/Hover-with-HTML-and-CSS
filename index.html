                Matrix code, also known as Matrix digital rain or sometimes green rain, is the computer code related 
                to the Matrix franchise. The falling green code is a way of representing the activity of the virtual 
                reality environment of the Matrix on screen. All four Matrix movies, as well as the spin-off Animatrix 
                episodes, open with the code. It is considered a characteristic mark of the franchise, more or less 
                like the opening crawl is for Star Wars.

            The Matrix
Goaded and harassed in the factory
  hat tears our life up into bits of days
  Ticked off upon a clock which never stays,
Shredding our portion of Eternity,
We break away at last, and steal the key
  Which hides a world empty of hours; ways
  Of space unroll, and Heaven overlays
The leafy, sun-lit earth of Fantasy.
  Beyond the ilex shadow glares the sun,
  Scorching against the blue flame of the sky.
Brown lily-pads lie heavy and supine
  Within a granite basin, under one
  The bronze-gold glimmer of a carp; and I
Reach out my hand and pluck a nectarine.
         By Amy Lowell
